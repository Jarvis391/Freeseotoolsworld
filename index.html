            <h2>How Much Can You Earn from AdSense?</h2>
            <p>
                While it’s difficult to give an exact number without knowing your site’s niche, traffic, and audience engagement, here's a basic formula to calculate AdSense earnings:
            </p>

                For example, if your website receives 10,000 page views per month, a 3% CTR, and an average CPC of $0.50, your estimated earnings would be:
            </p>
            <p><strong>10,000 × 0.03 × $0.50 = $150 per month.</strong></p>
